# Flight-Reservation-Application
Created two mini web services applications- flight reservation and flight check-in interacting through REST API using Spring boot.

The basic structure of the application is as follows:

A user can login or sign up to flight reservation application, select the from, to, and date of journey of flight. Select the flights available for the date and specified locations. Select a particular flight and make a booking. Booking ID will be generated.

Then user can go to the checkin application. with the provided booking ID, user can login and then add number of bags and early checkin.

Upcoming features: Security, authorization and Front-end part on React
